# 🔍 Ad-Hoc Insights in Consumer Goods – AtliQ Hardware  

## ❓ What happens when a company lacks data-driven decisions?  

AtliQ Hardware—a leading computer hardware manufacturer—was expanding across **NA, LATAM, EU, and APAC** markets. But despite its growth, the management struggled to get **quick, actionable insights.**  

Decisions were based on gut feelings rather than solid data. **That had to change.**  

## 🚀 The Challenge: Can Data Unlock Business Potential?  

Tony Sharma, **Director of Data Analytics,** saw the gap. To fix it, he designed a **real-world SQL challenge** to find someone who could:  
- 🧩 **Extract critical insights** from raw business data.  
- 📊 [**Answer 10 urgent business questions**](https://github.com/adityaraj005/Ad-hoc-Insights/blob/45077b9940fcc7f4e68e31ff2effaebbb33d1e69/ad-hoc-requests.pdf) using SQL.  
- 🎯 **Present data in a way that drives decisions.**  

This wasn’t just about writing SQL queries. **It was about thinking like a business leader.**  

## 📂 The Data: What Are We Working With?  

To crack this challenge, I worked with:  
- **Sales & Revenue Data**: `fact_sales_monthly`, `fact_manufacturing_cost`, `fact_pre_invoice_discount`  
- **Customer & Product Details**: `dim_customer`, `dim_product`  
- **Data from FY 2020 & 2021**  

## ⚙️ The Approach: How Did I Solve It?  

1. 🔍 **Understanding the business problem** behind each request.  
2. 🛠 [**Writing efficient SQL queries**](https://github.com/adityaraj005/Ad-hoc-Insights/blob/45077b9940fcc7f4e68e31ff2effaebbb33d1e69/Requests%20script%20file.sql) to fetch precise insights.  
3. 📊 **Using Power BI** to visualize trends and highlight key takeaways.  

## 🔥 The Results: What Did We Uncover?  

Instead of listing every SQL query, I compiled the findings into two powerful resources:  
📽 **Video Walkthrough** – Explaining each request, insights, and business impact. [Watch Here](https://youtu.be/4hBSVMWgS-o?feature=shared)  
📄 **Presentation PDF** – A structured document with all answers and insights.
